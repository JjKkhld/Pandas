# There are a few projects using Pandas in this repository. Each folder consists own project.

## 1. Ratings of companies
The main goal of the project was to create a visualization of the data downloaded from the Kaggle website. The data was first cleaned in the [first file](companies_proj/Companies_proj_1.ipynb). [The second file](companies_proj/Companies_proj_2_'other'.ipynb) was created to practice some pandas, numpy, and matplotlib functions/methods. In the third file, the data was prepared for visualization in Looker. [There is a screen](img/Visualisation_companies.png).
